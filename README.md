# robo-world

``sudo python setup.py install``

robo-world is an educational ``Python``-package designed for students to learn the basic programming contects such as

+ variables,
+ function calls,
+ conditionals, and
+ loops.

It consists of a ``world`` and the ``roboter`` which can be moved within the ``world``.
The ``world`` is a two-dimensional grid consisting of the ``roboter``, a spatial goal (a special gridpoint), movable and immovable objects.
Students have to design algorithm that move the ``roboter`` to its goal.

The ``roboter`` offers very basic methods such as

+ move one step forward, 
+ turn left by 90 degree, 
+ check if there is an obstacle in front.

Therefore, students have to prorgamm more sophisticated methods by themselves.
The learning goal is that they, step by step, build a set of function to navigate within the ``world``.
And by doing so, they hopefully pick up the most important programming fundamentals.
